# Single Page app
Modern web apps are often spas ([single page app](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application))

A single page app consists of a front end and a back end. 
The front end often is initally download by the browser. It typically consists of html, css, and javascript. It likely uses a front end javascript framework such as [react](https://reactjs.org/), angular, or vue.  The front end contains the logic for how the gui and screens looks.
The front end  makes [ajax](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/AJAX/Getting_Started) calls to the backend to fetch data through a [rest](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/REST) api.  Typically rest apis return the data in the json format.  The backend api typically stores data in a database. In this case the api is the database client and it communicates with the database server.    


The back end can be written in many different languages. Here are some popular backend rest api frameworks and languages.  
1. nodejs (express, hapi) - javascript 
2. rails - ruby 
3. django - python
